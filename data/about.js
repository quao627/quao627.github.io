        "I am a PhD student at the MIT <a href='https://idss.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>Institute of Data, Systems, and Society</a>, and I am fortunate to be mentored by <a href='https://pliang279.github.io/' target='_blank'>Prof. Paul Liang</a> from the MIT <a href='https://www.media.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>Media Lab</a> and <a href='https://www.eecs.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>EECS</a>, and <a href='https://zhaojinhua.com/' target='_blank'>Prof. Jinhua Zhao</a> from <a href='https://dusp.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>MIT DUSP</a>. I am also affiliated with <a href='https://m3s.mit.edu/' target='_blank'>SMART M3S</a>. Prior to joining MIT, I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics at Vanderbilt University.",
        
        "My long-term research goal is to build socially aware AI systems and advance their application in everyday life and societal systems. I envision a future where AI can adaptively and proactively <strong>perceive, reason, and communicate,</strong> seamlessly engaging with humans through rich multimodal interaction.",

    researchInterests: [
        "From model architecture to training methods, how can we build AI that can engage in <strong>real-time seamless interaction</strong> with humans? In particular, how can we design AI that can <strong>see, listen, think, and speak</strong> with native <strong>temporal alignment</strong>?",
        
        "Given <strong>video generation models</strong>' ability to represent space and time, can they help solve challenging problems in <strong>multimodal and social reasoning</strong>?",
        
        "How can we improve <strong>exploration</strong> in reinforcement learning so that agents can learn from <strong>openness rewards</strong>, or even <strong>without externally defined rewards</strong>?"
